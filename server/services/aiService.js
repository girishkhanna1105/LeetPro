The JSON object must have these exact keys: "strengths", "weaknesses", "actionableAdvice", and "recommendedQuestions".

1.  "strengths": A short string (1-2 sentences) positively highlighting the user's strongest topics based on their solve counts.
2.  "weaknesses": A short string (1-2 sentences) identifying the user's weakest topics. Be encouraging.
3.  "actionableAdvice": A single, clear, actionable next step for the user (2-3 sentences).
4.  "recommendedQuestions": An array of objects. Each object must represent a topic and have two keys:
    - "topic": The name of the DSA topic (e.g., "Arrays", "Dynamic Programming").
    - "questions": An array of 1-2 question objects for that topic. Each question object must have "title", "difficulty", and "reason" keys.
